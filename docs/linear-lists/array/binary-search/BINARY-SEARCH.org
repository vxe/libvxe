* BINARY-SEARCH

BINARY-SEARCH(x,T,p,r) 1 low = p 2 high = max(p, r + 1) 3 while low <
high 4 mid = floor(low + high / 2) 5 if x  <= T[mid] 6 high = mid 7
else low = mid +1 8 return high

The procedure BINARY-SEARCH(x,T,p,r) takes a key x and a subarray
T[p..r] and it returns one of the following:  * If T[p..r] is empty
(r<p), then it returns the index p.  * If x <= T[p] and hence less
than or equal to all the elements of T[p..r], then it returns the index
p. *  If x > T[p], then it returns the largest index q in the range p
< q  < r + 1 such that T[q  - 1] < x. Here is the pseudocode:
