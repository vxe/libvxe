* MERGE-SORT

MERGE-SORT(A,p,r) 1 if p < r 2 q = ⌊ b + r / 2 ⌋ 3 MERGE-SORT(A, p, q)
MERGE-SORT(A, q + 1, r) 5 MERGE(A, p, q, r)

We can now use the MERGE procedure as a subroutine in the merge sort
algorithm. The procedure MERGE-SORT(A, p, r) sorts the elements in the
subarray A[p..r]. If p ≥ r, the subarray has at most one element and is
therefore already sorted. Otherwise, the divide step simply computes an
index q that partitions A[p..r] into two subarrays: A[p.. q], containing
⌈n/2⌉ elements, and A[q + 1..r] containing ⌊n/2⌋ elements
