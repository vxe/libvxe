the thought he is fire up an nrepl server, and connect to it from
cider. its a long shot.  Lets put it init.oy


A hy lsp implementation would be ideal.  I lost weeks of my life
dealing with cider+nrepl

an evolutionary dead end, cider+nrepl can be a true nightmare at
times.  a hy lsp would be a major milestone, is anyone working on that?
