* LIST-SEARCH

The procedure LIST-SEARCH.L; k/ finds the first element with key k in
list L by a simple linear search, returning a pointer to this element.
If no object with key k appears in the list, then the procedure returns
NIL. For the linked list in Figure 10.3(a), the call LIST-SEARCH.L; 4/
returns a pointer to the third element, and the call LIST-SEARCH.L; 7/
returns NIL.

LIST-SEARCH(L,k) 1 x = L.head 2 while x ≠ NIL and x.key ≠ k 3 x = x.next
4 return x
