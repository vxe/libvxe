* Programming languages

  C++ code template
  A typical C++ code template for competitive programming looks like
  this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC c++
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>  // include the entire std library
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
    // solution comes here
    }

  #+END_SRC

  The #include line at the beginning of the code is a feature of the g++ compiler
  that allows us to include the entire standard library. Thus, it is not needed to
  separately include libraries such as iostream, vector and algorithm, but rather
  they are available automatically.
  The using line declares that the classes and functions of the standard library
  can be used directly in the code. Without the using line we would have to write,
  for example, std::cout, but now it suffices to write cout.
  The code can be compiled using the following command:
  g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall test.cpp -o test

  This command produces a binary file test from the source code test.cpp. The
  compiler follows the C++11 standard (-std=c++11), optimizes the code (-O2) and
  shows warnings about possible errors (-Wall).



** why c++
   Still, most problems in programming contests are set so that using a
   specific programming language is not an unfair advantage.  All
   example programs in this book are written in C++, and the standard
   libraryâ€™s data structures and algorithms are often used. The
   programs follow the C++11 standard, which can be used in most
   contests nowadays. If you cannot program in C++ yet, now is a good
   time to start learning.


     At the moment, the most popular programming languages used in
  contests are C++, Python and Java.




















** use python for large integers
   - if large integers are needed in the problem, Python can be a good choice,
   because it contains built-in operations for calculating with largeintegers. 

** language usage breakdown
   For example, in Google Code Jam
   2017, among the best 3,000 participants, 
     - 79 % used C++, 
     - 16 % used Python and 
     - 8 % used Java [29].
