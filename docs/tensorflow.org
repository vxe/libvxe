** plot the pixels?

** observe the shape of the image array
the tuple (60000 28 28)
means you have 60000 images each one consisting of 2 vectors of length
28, the pair of which represents on pixel.
#+BEGIN_SRC hy
  (defn np-shape [array]
        (numpy.ma.shape array))

(np-shape training-images)
; (60000, 28, 28)
#+END_SRC



** give human readable names to images classes (training/test-images)
#+BEGIN_SRC hy
  (setv image-class-names ["T-shirt/top" "Trouser" "Pullover" "Dress" "Coat" 
  "Sandal" "Shirt" "Sneaker" "Bag" "Ankle boot"])  
#+END_SRC
** extract the test and training data images and labels
#+BEGIN_SRC hy
  (setv training-data (first (.load_data fashion_mnist))) ; 60,000 images
  (setv training-images (first training-data))
  (setv training-labels (second training-data))
