Linear lists in which insertions, deletions, and accesses to values
occur almost always at the first or the last node are very frequently
encountered, and we give them special names:

A stack is a linear list for which all insertions and deletions (and
usually all accesses) are made at one end of the list.

A queue is a linear list for which all insertions are made at one end of
the list; all deletions (and usually all accesses) are made at the other
end.

A deque (“ double-ended queue”) is a linear list for which all
insertions and deletions (and usually all accesses) are made at the ends
of the list.
