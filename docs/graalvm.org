good old graal, the coolest thing to happen to the industry and
potentially the thing which will bring its all to its knees.  In
either case its probably worth knowing there is to about it.
** Overview :TOC:
- [[#hello-world][hello world]]

* hello world
  - [ ] add graalvm to PATH
  - [ ] statement to create a [[https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/Source.html][Source]] object
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  ;; this is broken because you can't eval plain string, you need a Source object
    (let [vm (org.graalvm.polyglot.Context/create (into-array String ["js"] ))]
      (.eval vm "print('hi')"))
  #+END_SRC


  yeah!  not bad, also for some reason, cider doesn't like my
  CLASSPATH, its not seeing truffle, I'll paste the error here some
  time.
