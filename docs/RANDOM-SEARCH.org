* RANDOM-SEARCH

5-2 Searching an unsorted array

This problem examines three algorithms for searching for a value x in an
unsorte= array A consisting of n elements. Consider the following
randomized strategy. pick a random index i into A. If A[i] = x, then we
terminate, otherwise, we continue the search by picking a new random
index into A. We continue picking random indices into A until we fin= an
index j such that A[j] = x or until we have checke= every element of A.
Note that we pick from the whole set of indices each time, so that we
may examine a given element more than once.
