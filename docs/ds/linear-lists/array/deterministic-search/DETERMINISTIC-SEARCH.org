* DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH

Now consider a deterministic linear search algorithm, which we refer to
as DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH. Specifically, the algorithm searches A for x in
order, considering AOE1; AŒ2; AŒ3;:::; AŒn until either it finds
AOEi D x or it reaches the end of the array. Assume that all possible
permutations of the input array are equally likely.
