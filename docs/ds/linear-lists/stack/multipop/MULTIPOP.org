* MULTIPOP

Now we add the stack operation MULTIPOP(S, k) , which removes the k top
objects of stack S, popping the entire stack if the stack contains fewer
than k objects. Of course, we assume that k is positive; otherwise the
MULTIPOP operation leaves the stack unchanged. In the following
pseudocode, the operation STACK-EMPTY returns TRUE if there are no
objects currently on the stack, and FALSE otherwise.

MULTIPOP(S, k) 1 while not STACK-EMPTY(S) and k > 0 2 POP(S) 3 k = k - 1
