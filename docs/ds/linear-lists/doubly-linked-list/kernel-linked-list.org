The linked list is the simplest and most common data structure in the
Linux kernel. A *linked list* is a data structure that allows the
storage and manipulation of a variable number of *elements*, called the
*nodes* of the list.

"Oftentimes, however, it is desirable simply to iterate over all
processes in the system. This is easy because the task list is a
circular, doubly linked list"
