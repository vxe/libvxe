* LUP-DECOMPOSITION

The idea behind LUP decomposition is to find three n n matrices L, U,
and P such that PA D LU; (28.4) where  * L is a unit lower-triangular
matrix,  * U is an upper-triangular matrix, and  * P is a permutation
matrix.

LUP-DECOMPOSITION(A) 1 n = A.rows 2 let π[1.. n] be a new array 3 for i
= 1 to n 4 π[i] = i 5 for k = 1 to n 6 p = 0 7 for i = k to n 8 if |aᵢₖ|
> p 9 p = |aᵢₖ| 10 k' = i 11 if p == 0 12 error “singular matrix” 13
exchange π[k] with π[k'] 14 for i = 1 to n 15 exchange aₖᵢ with a\_{k'i}
16 for i = k + 1 to n 17 aᵢₖ = aᵢₖ/aₖₖ 18 for j = k + 1 to n 19 aᵢⱼ =
aᵢⱼ - aᵢₖaₖⱼ
