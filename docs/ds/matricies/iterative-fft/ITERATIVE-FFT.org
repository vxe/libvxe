* ITERATIVE-FFT

ITERATIVE-FFT(a) 1 BIT-REVERSE-COPY(a,A) 2 n = a.length n is a power of
2 3 for s = 1 to lg n 4 m = 2ˢ 5 ωₘ = e\^2πi/m 6 for k = 0 to n - 1 by m
7 ω = 1 8 for j = 0 to m/2 - 1 9 t = ωA[k + j + m/2] 10 u = A[k + j] 11
A[k + j] = u + t 12 A[k + j + m/2] = u - t 13 ω = ω ωₘ 14 return A

runs in Θ(n lg n )
