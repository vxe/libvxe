A vector space (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects
called vectors, which may be
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition][added]] together and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication][multiplied]]
("scaled") by numbers, called
*[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)][scalars]]*.
Scalars are often taken to be
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number][real numbers]] , but there
are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number][complex numbers]] ,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number][rational numbers]] , or
generally any
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)][field]] . The
operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy
certain requirements, called
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom][axioms]] , listed below.
