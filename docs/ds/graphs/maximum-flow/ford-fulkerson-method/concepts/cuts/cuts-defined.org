Cuts of flow networks The Ford-Fulkerson method repeatedly augments the
flow along augmenting paths until it has found a maximum flow. How do we
know that when the algorithm terminates, we have actually found a
maximum flow? The max-flow min-cut theorem, which we shall prove
shortly, tells us that a flow is maximum if and only if its residual
network contains no augmenting path. To prove this theorem, though, we
must first explore the notion of a cut of a flow network.
