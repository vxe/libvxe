* augmenting-paths

Augmenting paths Given a flow network G(V,E) and a flow f, an
*augmenting path* p is a simple path from s to t in the residual network
G\_f. By the definition of the residual network, we may increase the
flow on an edge (u,v) of an augmenting path by up to c\_f(u,v)/ without
violating the capacity constraint on whichever of (u,v) and (v,u) is in
the original flow network G.
