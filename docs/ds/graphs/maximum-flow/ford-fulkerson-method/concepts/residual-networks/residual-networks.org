* residual-networks

defined Residual networks Intuitively, given a flow network G and a flow
f, the residual network G\_f consists of edges with capacities that
represent how we can change the flow on edges of G. An edge of the flow
network can admit an amount of additional flow equal to the edge's
capacity minus the flow on that edge. If that value is positive, we
place that edge into G\_f with a “residual capacity” of c\_f (u,v) =
c(u,v) - f(u,v). The only edges of G that are in G\_f are those that can
admit more flow, those edges (u,v) whose flow equals their capacity have
c\_f(u,v) = 0, and they are not in G\_f.
