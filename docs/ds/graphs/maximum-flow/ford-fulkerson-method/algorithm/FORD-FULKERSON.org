This section presents the Ford-Fulkerson method for solving the
maximum-flow problem. We call it a “method” rather than an “algorithm”
because it encompasses several implementations with differing running
times. The Ford-Fulkerson method depends on three important ideas that
transcend the method and are relevant to many flow algorithms and
problems: residual networks, augmenting paths, and cuts.

1. residual networks
2. augmenting path
3. cuts
