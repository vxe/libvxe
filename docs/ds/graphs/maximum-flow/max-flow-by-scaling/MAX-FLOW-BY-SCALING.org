* MAX-FLOW-BY-SCALING

We can use the following modification of FORD-FULKERSON-METHOD to
compute a maximum flow in G:

MAX-FLOW-BY-SCALING(G,s,t) 1 C = max₍ᵤᵥ₎\_∈E c(u,v) 2 initialize flow f
to 0 3 K = 2\^⌊lgC⌋\\
4 while K ≥ 1 5 while there exists an augmenting path p of capacity at
least K 6 augment flow f along p 7 K = K / 2 8 return f
