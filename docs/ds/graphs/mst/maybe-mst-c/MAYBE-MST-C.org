* MAYBE-MST-C

In this problem, we give pseudocode for three different algorithms. Each
one takes a connected graph and a weight function as input and returns a
set of edges T. For each algorithm, either prove that T is a minimum
spanning tree or prove that T is not necessarily a minimum spanning
tree. Also describe the most efficient implementation of each algorithm,
whether or not it computes a minimum spanning tree.

MAYBE-MST-C(G,w) 1 T = ∅ 2 for each edge e, taken in arbitrary order 3 T
= T ∪ {e} 4 if T has a cycle c 5 let e' be a maximum-weight edge on c 6
T = T - {e'} 7 return T
