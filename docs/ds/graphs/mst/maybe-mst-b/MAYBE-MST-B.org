* MAYBE-MST-B

MAYBE-MST-B(G, w) 1 T = ∅ 2 for each edge e, taken in arbitrary order 3
if T ∪ {e} has no cycles 4 T = T ∪ {e} 5 return T

In this problem, we give pseudocode for three different algorithms. Each
one takes a connected graph and a weight function as input and returns a
set of edges T. For each algorithm, either prove that T is a minimum
spanning tree or prove that T is not necessarily a minimum spanning
tree. Also describe the most efficient implementation of each algorithm,
whether or not it computes a minimum spanning tree.
