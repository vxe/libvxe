* MAYBE-MST-A

MAYBE-MST-A(G,w) 1 sort the edges into nonincreasing order of edge
weights w 2 T = E 3 for each edge e, taken in nonincreasing order by
weight 4 if T - {e} is a connected graph 5 T = T - {e} 6 return T

In this problem, we give pseudocode for three different algorithms. Each
one takes a connected graph and a weight function as input and returns a
set of edges T. For each algorithm, either prove that T is a minimum
spanning tree or prove that T is not necessarily a minimum spanning
tree. Also describe the most efficient implementation of each algorithm,
whether or not it computes a minimum spanning tree.
