* HOPCROFT-KARP

Give an algorithm that runs in O(E) time to find a maximal set of
vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths P₁, P₂,...,Pₖ for a given
matching M. Conclude that the total running time of HOPCROFT-KARP is
O(√V E)

HOPCROFT-KARP(G) 1 M = ∅ 2 repeat 3 let P = {P₁, P₂,...,Pₖ} be a maximal
set of vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths with respect to M 4 M =
M ⨂ (P₁ ∪ p₂ ∪ ... ∪ pₖ) 5 until P == ∅ 6 return M
