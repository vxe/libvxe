The strategy followed by depth-first search is, as its name implies, to
search “deeper” in the graph whenever possible. Depth-first search
explores edges out of the most recently discovered vertex  that still
has unexplored edges leaving it. Once all of 's edges have been
explored, the search “backtracks” to explore edges leaving the vertex
from which  was discovered. This process continues until we have
discovered all the vertices that are reachable from the original source
vertex. If any undiscovered vertices remain, then depth-first search
selects one of them as a new source, and it repeats the search from that
source. The algorithm repeats this entire process until it has
discovered every vertex.3
