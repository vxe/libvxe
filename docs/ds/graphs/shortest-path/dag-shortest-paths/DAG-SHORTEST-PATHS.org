* DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS

DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS(G,w,s) 1 topologically sort the vertices of G 2
INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G,s) 3 for each vertex u, taken in
topologically sorted order 4 for each vertex u âˆˆ G.Adj[u] 5 RELAX(u,v,w)

according to a topological sort of its vertices, we can compute shortest
paths from a single source in O(V + E) time. Shortest paths are always
well defind= in a dag, since even if there are negative-weight edges, no
negative-weight cycles can exist.
