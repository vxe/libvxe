* APPROX-TSP-TOUR

APPROX-TSP-TOUR(G,c) 1 select a vertex r in G.V to be a “root” vertex 2
compute a minimum spanning tree T for G from root r using
MST-PRIM(G,c,r) 3 let H be a list of vertices, ordered according to when
they are first visited in a preorder tree walk of T 4 return the
hamiltonian cycle H

The parameter G is a complete undirected graph, and the cost function c
satisfies the triangle inequality.

Theorem 35.2 APPROX-TSP-TOUR is a polynomial-time 2-approximation
algorithm for the traveling-salesman problem with the triangle
inequality.
