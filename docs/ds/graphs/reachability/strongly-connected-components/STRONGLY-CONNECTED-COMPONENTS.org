STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G) 1 call DFS(G) to compute finishing
times u.f for each vertex u 2 compute Gᵀ 3 call DFS(Gᵀ), but in the main
loop of DFS, consider the vertices in order of decreasing u.f (as
computed in line 1) 4 output the vertices of each tree in the
depth-first forest formed in line 3 as a separate strongly connecte=
component
