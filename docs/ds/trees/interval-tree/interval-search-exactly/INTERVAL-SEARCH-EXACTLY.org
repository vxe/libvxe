* INTERVAL-SEARCH-EXACTLY

Suggest modifications to the interval-tree procedures to support the new
operation INTERVAL-SEARCH-EXACTLY.T; i\_, where T is an interval tree
and i is an interval. The operation should return a pointer to a node x
in T such that x:int:low D i:low and x:int:high D i:high, or T:nil if T
contains no such node. All operations, including
INTERVAL-SEARCH-EXACTLY, should run in O.lg n\_ time on an n-node
interval tree.
