* INTERVAL-INSERT

Design a data structure that efficiently supports the operations
INTERVALINSERT, INTERVAL-DELETE, and FIND-POM, which returns a point of
maximum overlap. (Hint: Keep a red-black tree of all the endpoints.
Associate a value of C1 with each left endpoint, and associate a value
of 1 with each right endpoint. Augment each node of the tree with some
extra information to maintain the point of maximum overlap.)
