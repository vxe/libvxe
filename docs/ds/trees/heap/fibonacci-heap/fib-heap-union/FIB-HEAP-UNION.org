* FIB-HEAP-UNION

The following procedure unites Fibonacci heaps H₁ and H₂, destroying H₁
and H₂ in the process. It simply concatenates the root lists of H₁ and
H₂ and then determines the new minimum node. Afterward, the objects
representing H₁ and H₂ will never be used again.

FIB-HEAP-UNION(H₁, H₂) 1 H = MAKE-FIB-HEAP() 2 H.min = H₁.min 3
concatenate the root list of H₂ with the root list of H 4 if (H₁.min ==
NIL or H₂.min ≠ NIL and= H₂.min.key < H₁.min.key) 5 H.min = H₂.min 6 H.n
= H₁.n + H₂.n 7 return H
