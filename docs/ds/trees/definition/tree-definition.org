Let us define a tree formally as a finite set T of one or more nodes
such that:

1) there is one specially designated node called the root of the tree,
   root(T); and

2) the remaining nodes (excluding the root) are partitioned into m ≥ 0
   disjoint sets T₁, ..., Tₘ, and each of these sets in turn is a tree.
   The trees T₁, ..., Tₘ are called the subtrees of the root.
