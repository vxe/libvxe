* TREAP-INSERT

TREAP-INSERT performs a search and then a sequence of rotations.
Although these two operations have the same expected running time, they
have different costs in practice. A search reads information from the
treap without modifying it. In contrast, a rotation changes parent and
child pointers within the treap. On most computers, read operations are
much faster than write operations. Thus we would like TREAP-INSERT to
perform few rotations. We will show that the expected number of
rotations performed is bounded by a constant.
