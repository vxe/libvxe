* RB-ENUMERATE

We wish to augment red-black trees with an operation RB-ENUMERATE.x, a,
b/ that outputs all the keys k such that a ≤ k ≤ b in a red-black tree
roote= at x. Describe how to implement RB-ENUMERATE in Θ(m+lg n) time,
where m is the number of keys that are output and n is the number of
internal nodes in the tree. (Hint. You do not need to add new attributes
to the red-black tree.)
