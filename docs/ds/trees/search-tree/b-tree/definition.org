In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][computer science]]
, a B-tree is a self-balancing
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure][tree data
structure]] that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential
access, insertions, and deletions in
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_time][logarithmic time]] .
The B-tree is a generalization of a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree][binary search tree]]
in that a node can have more than two children.[1] Unlike
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree][self-balancing
binary search trees]] , the B-tree is well suited for storage systems
that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs. It
is commonly used in
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database][databases]] and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem][filesystems]] . What, if
anything, the *B* stands for has never been established.
