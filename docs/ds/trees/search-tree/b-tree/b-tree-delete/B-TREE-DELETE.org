* B-TREE-DELETE

The procedure B-TREE-DELETE deletes the key k from the subtree rooted at
x. We design this procedure to guarantee that whenever it calls itself
recursively on a node x, the number of keys in x is at least the minimum
degree t. Note that this condition requires one more key than the
minimum required by the usual B-tree conditions, so that sometimes a key
may have to be moved into a child node before recursion descends to that
child. This strengthened condition allows us to delete a key from the
tree in one downward pass without having to “back up” (with one
exception, which we'll explain).
