* AVL-INSERT

13-3 AVL trees

An AVL tree is a binary search tree that is height balanced: for each
node x, the heights of the left and right subtrees of x differ by at
most 1. To implement an AVL tree, we maintain an extra attribute in each
node: x.h is the height of node x. As for any other binary search tree
T, we assume that T.root points to the root node.
