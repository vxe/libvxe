* OFF-LINE-MINIMUM

OFF-LINE-MINIMUM(m,n) 1 for i = 1 to n 2 determine j such that i ∈ Kⱼ 3
if j ≠ m + 1 4 extracted[j] = i 5 let l be the smallest value greater
than j for which set Kₗ exists 6 Kₗ = Kⱼ ∪ Kₗ destroying Kⱼ 7 return
extracted

The off-line minimum problem asks us to maintain a dynamic set T of
elements from the domain {1, 2,..., n} under the operations INSERT and
EXTRACT-MIN.
