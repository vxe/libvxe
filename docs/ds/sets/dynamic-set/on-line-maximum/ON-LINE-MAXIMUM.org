ON-LINE-MAXIMUM(k,n) 1 bestscore = -âˆž 2 for i = 1 to k 3 if score(i) >
bestscore 4 bestscore = score(i) 5 for i = k + 1 to n 6 if score(i) >
bestscore 7 return i 8 return n

If it turns out that the best-qualified applicant was among the first k
interviewed, then we hire the nth applicant. We formalize this strategy
in the procedure ON-LINE-MAXIMUM(kin), which returns the index of the
candidate we wish to hire.
