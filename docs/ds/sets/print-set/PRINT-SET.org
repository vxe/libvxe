* PRINT-SET

Suppose that we wish to add the operation PRINT-SET.x\_, which is given
a node x and prints all the members of x's set, in any order. Show how
we can add just a single attribute to each node in a disjoint-set forest
so that PRINT-SET.x\_ takes time linear in the number of members of x's
set and the asymptotic running times of the other operations are
unchanged. Assume that we can print each member of the set in O.1/ time.
