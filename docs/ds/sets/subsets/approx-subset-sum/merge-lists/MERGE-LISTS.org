* MERGE-LISTS

We also use an auxiliary procedure MERGE-LISTS.L; L0/, which returns the
sorted list that is the merge of its two sorted input lists L and L0
with duplicate values removed. Like the MERGE procedure we used in merge
sort (Section 2.3.1), MERGE-LISTS runs in time O.jLj C jL0 j/. We omit
the pseudocode for MERGELISTS.
