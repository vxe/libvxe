* ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT

The following algorithm takes as input a set S of n line segments,
returning the boolean value TRUE if any pair of segments in S
intersects, and FALSE otherwise. A *red-black tree* maintains the total
preorder T.

ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT(S) 1 T = nil 2 *sort the endpoints of the
segments in S from left to right, breaking ties by putting left
endpoints before right endpoints and breaking further ties by putting
points with lower y-coordinates first* 3 for each point p in the sorted
list of endpoints 4 if p is the left endpoint of a segment s 5
INSERT(T,s) 6 if ((ABOVE(T,s) exists and intersects s) or (BELOW.T; s/
exists and intersects s)) 7 return TRUE 8 if (p is the right endpoint of
a segment s) 9 if ((both ABOVE(T,s) and BELOW(T,s) exist\\
 and ABOVE(T,s) intersects BELOW(T,s)) 10 return TRUE 11 DELETE(T,s) 12
return FALSE
