* PRINT-INTERSECTING-SEGMENTS

The professor calls the resulting procedure PRINT-INTERSECTING-SEGMENTS
and claims that it prints all intersections, from left to right, as they
occur in the set of line segments. Professor Dixon disagrees, claiming
that Professor Mason's idea is incorrect. Which professor is right? Will
PRINT-INTERSECTING-SEGMENTS always find the leftmost intersection first?
Will it always find all the intersections?
