* GRAHAM-SCAN

GRAHAM-SCAN(Q) 1 let p₀ be the point in Q with the minimum y-coordinate,
or the leftmost such point in case of a tie 2 let be the remaining
points in Q, sorted by polar angle in counterclockwise order around p₀
(if more than one point has the same angle, remove all but the one that
is farthest from p₀) 3 if m < 2 4 return “convex hull is empty” 5 else
let S be an empty stack 6 PUSH(S,P₀) 7 PUSH(S,P₁) 8 PUSH(S,P₂) 9 for i =
3 to m 10 while the angle formed by points NEXT-TO-TOP(S), TOP(S), and
pᵢ makes a nonleft turn 11 POP(S) 12 PUSH(S,Pᵢ) 13 return S
