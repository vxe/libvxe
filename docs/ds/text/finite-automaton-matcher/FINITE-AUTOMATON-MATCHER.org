* FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER

FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER(T,δ,m) 1 n = T.length 2 q = 0 3 for i = 1 to n
4 q = δ(q, T[i]) 5 if q == m 6 print “Pattern occurs with shift” i -m

To clarify the operation of a string-matching automaton, we now give a
simple, efficient program for simulating the behavior of such an
automaton (represented by its transition function δ) in finding
occurrences of a pattern P of length m in an input text T [1..n].
