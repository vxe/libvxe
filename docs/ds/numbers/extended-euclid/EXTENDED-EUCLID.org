EXTENDED-EUCLID(a,b) 1 if b = = 0 2 return (a,1,0) 3 else (d',x',y') =
EXTENDED-EUCLID(b, a mod b) 4 (d, x, y) = (d', y', x' - ⌊a/b⌋ y') 5
return (d,x,y)

We now rewrite Euclid's algorithm to compute additional useful
information. Specifically, we extend the algorithm to compute the
integer coefficients x and y such that

d = gcd(a,b) = ax + by
