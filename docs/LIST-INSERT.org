* LIST-INSERT

Inserting into a linked list Given an element x whose key attribute has
already been set, the LIST-INSERT procedure “splices” x onto the front
of the linked list, as shown in Figure 10.3(b).

LIST-INSERT(L,x) 1 x.next = L.head 2 if L.head ≠ NIL 3 L.head.prev = x 4
L.head = x 5 x.prev = NIL
