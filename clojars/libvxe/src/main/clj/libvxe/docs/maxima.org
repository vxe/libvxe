At this level of algebraic abstraction we do all operations using
variable elimination.  Variable elimination is the process of
combining n polynomial equations so that m variables do not appear in
the (n-m) resulting equations (where n > m).  Common techniques used
include resultants [1][2][4][5] and Groebner Bases [3][4][5].
